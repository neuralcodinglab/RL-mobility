### Description of experiment

Test different hyperparameter settings (Learning rate and Gamma) 


## Reward scheme
10 for each forward step
-1 for each side step
-20 for each box collision
-10 for each wall collision
50 at every 200 forward steps 

## Training parameters 
MAX_EPISODES = 1200 # number of episodes (an episode ends after agent hits a box)
MAX_STEPS  = 1e7  # number of optimization steps (each time step the model parameters are updated)
RESET_UPON_END_SIGNAL = {0:False,  # Nothing happened
                         1:True,   # Box collision
                         2:False,  # Wall collision
                         3:True}  # Reached step target
RESET_AFTER_NR_SIDESTEPS = 5
